This packages exposes pakk to be used on it's own, preferrably after another
tool built your library. At this point this cli will adjust both your `source`
and `dist` packageJson files.

> By using pakk like this you are expected to ensure your build tool emits the
> output the same way pakk generates the package.json.

If you're using [`vite`](https://vitejs.dev/) as your build tool I recommend
using the vite plugin form of this tool: [`vite-plugin-pakk`](../vite-plugin/)

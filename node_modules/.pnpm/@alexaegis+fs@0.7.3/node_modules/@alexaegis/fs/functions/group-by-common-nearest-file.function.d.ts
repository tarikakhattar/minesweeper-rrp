 * Groups together paths based on the nearest path where the filename exists.

 * For example if you have a lot of path's for TS files all over a monorepo and
 * you want to group them by their nearest tsconfig.json file.
 * When you define the second param as 'tsconfig.json' this function will
 * find the nearest 'tsconfig.json' file for every path passed in the first
 * param by walking up its directory chain. The absolute path of that
 * 'tsconfig.json' will be the key of the group.
